# Overview
This is 3rd project of Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity. It gives a hand-on experience in Pandas, NumPy and matplotlib.

# Description
This data set is from the list of curated data sets provided by Udacity for this project.
It contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database(TMDb).
* Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
* There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
* The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars,
accounting for inflation over time.

I posed some questions in the starting of the project and then addressed those questions in my analysis.

I used Pandas, NumPy and matplotlib to generate statistical conclusion throughout my project.

Limitations of this data are also mentioned after my conclusion.
